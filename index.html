    /*
    PROBLEM 1:
    In the following code, we are selecting all the elements above this script tag, and adding a click event listener to each.
    ðŸ‘‰ Inside the event listener, study the event object with a console log. Find the `currentTarget` property of the event object.
    ðŸ‘‰ Extract the `className` and the `nodeName` properties from the `currentTarget` and store them into variables.
    ðŸ‘‰ Create a log statement that will print something like "The <className> element is a <nodeName>", using your variables to construct the string.
    ðŸ‘‰ Click the button, and observe in the console the firing of the listeners, as the event bubbles up the DOM!
    ðŸ‘‰ Note how the listener attached to the target fires first.
    */
    let elements = Array.from(document.getElementsByTagName('*'))
    elements.forEach(element => {
      element.addEventListener('click', event => {
        // ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
      })
    })

    /*
    PROBLEM 2:
    It's possible to set up a click listener so that it executes as the event dives towards the target of the event.
    ðŸ‘‰ Note that in `addEventListener` above, the first argument is the string 'click' and the second argument is a function.
    ðŸ‘‰ Add a third argument which is an object like so: { capture: true }. This object allows to pass options into `addEventListener`
    ðŸ‘‰ Click the button, and observe in the console how the order of execution of the listeners reverses itself, with the target firing last.
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 3:
    Sometimes you need to know if the event is currently firing on one element or another, to take different actions.
    ðŸ‘‰ Inside the click event listener above add code so that if the current target is equal to the section element, console log "I love this section!"
    ðŸ‘‰ In order to compare event.currentTarget to the section, you'll need to grab the section element using querySelector.
